\begin{abstract}
    Giteviews is an Eviews add-in that can be used to run git commands and seeing their log output from Eviews.  It includes a 
    a Git GUI entry in the Add-ins menu that will start a GUI of Git when selected.
\end{abstract}

\section{Summary}

Git is a version control system that can be run from a command line or from several available GUIs, including Git GUI, a GUI that is packaged with Git.  This add-in 
provides a direct connection to the git command line from Eviews and access to Git GUI from the Add-Ins drop-down menu.  Giteviews enables users to run 
an exact copy of a git command directly from Eviews; it also displays git log output in an Eviews log window.  For example, running
 
\begin{verbatim}
    git commit -m "enter message"
\end{verbatim}

\noindent from an Eviews program or the Eviews Command window will commit staged files with the given message.  

\subsection{Giteviews Options}
  
  The add-in has two options: 
  \begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll} \hline \hline
    Option          & Default       & Description \\ \hline
    log             & true          & display git logs in the Eviews log window \\
    repo\_path      & @datapath     & points to the repository location \\ \hline \hline \\
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

For example, running
\begin{verbatim}
    git(repo_path = U:/filename, log = false) commit -m "enter message"
\end{verbatim}

will commit the files in the repo located in the U:/filename folder, and it will suppress the log output.
